# Cost: Artisanal Fishing Pressure



#### **STEP 1: Read in Mozambique EEZ and Shapefile**
```{r}
## read in MZ EEZ tif
mz_rast_id <- raster(here("set_up/final_rasters/mz_eez_templates/mz_rast_id.tif"))

## Grab Moz Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shapefile from local computer
mz_eez_path <- 'G:/group_project/data/mz_eez'
mz_shape <- list.files(mz_eez_path, full.names = TRUE) 

mz_eez_sf <- sf::read_sf(mz_shape[6])

## check coordinate system
st_crs(mz_eez_sf)

## Add a buffer of 10 km to make sure cells on the outer edges of the EEZ are included
mz_eez_buffer_sf <- sf::st_buffer(mz_eez_sf, dist = 10000)
```


```{r}
### pull in the artisanal fishing pressure tif file from costs folder in repo
art_fish_rast <- raster(here("set_up", "raw_data", "artisanal", "kernel_d_fishing_moz_v2.tif"))

### now we need to grab the Moz raster we previously created to make sure the artisanal fishing raster is in the right projections
art_fish <- raster::projectRaster(art_fish_rast, mz_rast_id, 
                                  res = 10000, 
                                  method = 'ngb')

### create a data frame to see what value ranges we are working with
art_fish_df <- as.data.frame(art_fish)

### plot to see what it looks like
plot(art_fish)

### Priortizr does not like cost values of NA so first let's change all the NA's --> 0
art_fish[is.na(art_fish[])] <- 0
plot(art_fish)

### since we changed all NAs to 0 we need to again mask it to change values on land and past the EEZ to NA
art_fish <- mask(art_fish, mz_eez_sf)
plot(art_fish)

### now let's check it #0-1 method
art_fish_df <- art_fish %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(artisanal_convert = case_when(kernel_d_fishing_moz_v2 < 0.1 ~ 0,
                                       TRUE ~ as.numeric(.$kernel_d_fishing_moz_v2))) %>%
  mutate(artisanal_rescale = artisanal_convert/max(artisanal_convert, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(artisanal_nonzero = case_when(artisanal_rescale == 0 ~ .0001, 
                                      TRUE ~ as.numeric(.$artisanal_rescale))) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n())

### another way to rescale from 0 to 1
#art_fish_rescaled <- log(art_fish+1)/ cellStats(log(art_fish+1), max)
# art_fish_rescaled <- art_fish/maxValue(art_fish)
# plot(art_fish_rescaled)

### let's check it again!
# art_fish_rescaled_df <- art_fish_rescaled %>% 
#   as.data.frame() 

### now that we've changed the zeros and rescaled, convert back to a raster
art_fish_rescaled <- subs(mz_rast_id, art_fish_df, by = 'id', which = 'artisanal_nonzero')
plot(art_fish_rescaled)

## Looks good lets save as a tif
writeRaster(art_fish_rescaled, here('set_up/final_rasters/costs/cost_art_fish.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```


```{r}
tmap_mode("view") # Set to interactive viewing

tm_shape(art_fish_rescaled) +
  tm_basemap("Stamen.Terrain")+
  tm_raster("artisanal_nonzero", alpha=0.9, palette = "viridis")
  
```
