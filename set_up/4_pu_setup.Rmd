# Planning Units and Locked In & Out Areas

Part of the setup for `Prioritzr` we need to establish our planning units based on the project area and the areas either locked-in or out of the analysis. The actual planning units were already created in `1_MZ_EEZ_raster.Rmd` named `mz_rast_id`, which basically gives each cell in the raster a value. This value will be the same across all rasters created. The existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), and Aggregation Sites are rasters that we considered locking in and out of our analysis. Locking-in means that the spatial prioritizations will *always include* those areas we locked in, while locking-out will *always exclude* those areas. 

### **STEP 1: Read in Mozambique EEZ and Shapefile**
Grabbing the project area from the `1_MZ_EEZ_raster.Rmd` with the cell ids and the shapefiles.

```{r}
## read in MZ EEZ tif
mz_rast_id <- raster(here("set_up/final_rasters/mz_eez_templates/mz_rast_id.tif"))

## Grab Moz Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shapefile from local computer
mz_eez_path <- 'G:/group_project/data/mz_eez'
mz_shape <- list.files(mz_eez_path, full.names = TRUE) 

mz_eez_sf <- sf::read_sf(mz_shape[6])

## check coordinate system
st_crs(mz_eez_sf)

## Add a buffer of 10 km to make sure cells on the outer edges of the EEZ are included
mz_eez_buffer_sf <- sf::st_buffer(mz_eez_sf, dist = 10000)
```


### **STEP 2: Setting up existing marine protected areas**
Using a shapefile containing the existing MPAs in Mozambique's EEZ provided by WCS, we created a raster based on our `mz_rast_id` raster.

```{r}
## Grab protected area shapefile from computer
exist_mpa_path <- 'G:/group_project/data/existing_mpas'
mpa_shape <- list.files(exist_mpa_path, full.names = TRUE)

## Read in the shapefile as a simple feature
mpa_sf <- sf::read_sf(mpa_shape[6]) 

## Check the CRS of the simple feature to make sure it matches the Mozambique Raster 
st_crs(mpa_sf)

## CRS matches so lets make a raster using the mz_rast_id to set the extent
mpa_rast <- fasterize::fasterize(mpa_sf, mz_rast_id)

## Double check the CRS again 
crs(mpa_rast)

## Plot to make sure it looks good, note this shapefile includes all terrestrial protected areas as well so we need to clip it to just include those in the water (the EEZ)
plot(mpa_rast)

## Mask the rater to the EEZ 
mpa_rast <- mask(mpa_rast, mz_eez_sf) 

## Double check CRS of new raster & plot to make sure it looks good
crs(mpa_rast)
plot(mpa_rast)

## Looks good! Save as a tif file
writeRaster(mpa_rast, here('set_up/final_rasters/planning_unit/exist_mpa.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```


### **STEP 3: Set up key biodiversity areas**
Using a shapefile containing the existing KBAs in Mozambique's EEZ provided by WCS, we created a raster based on our `mz_rast_id` raster.

```{r}
## Read in oil tif from local computer as a raster
kba_path <- 'G:/group_project/data/kba'
kba_shape <- list.files(kba_path, full.names = TRUE)

## Read in the shapefile as a simple feature
kba_sf <- sf::read_sf(kba_shape[6]) 

## Check the CRS of the simple feature to make sure it matches the Mozambique Raster 
st_crs(kba_sf)

## CRS matches so lets make a raster using the mz_rast_id to set the extent
kba_rast <- fasterize::fasterize(kba_sf, mz_rast_id)

## Double check the CRS again 
crs(kba_rast)

## Plot to make sure it looks good, note this shapefile includes all terrestrial protected areas as well so we need to clip it to just include those in the water (the EEZ)
plot(kba_rast)

## Mask the rater to the EEZ 
kba_rast <- mask(kba_rast, mz_eez_sf) 

## Double check CRS of new raster & plot to make sure it looks good
crs(kba_rast)
plot(kba_rast)

## Looks good! Save as a tif file
writeRaster(kba_rast, here('set_up/final_rasters/planning_unit/kba.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```


### **STEP 4: Set up aggregation sites**
Using a shapefile containing the known aggregation sites in Mozambique's EEZ provided by WCS, we created a raster based on our `mz_rast_id` raster.

```{r}
## Read in oil tif from local computer as a raster
aggregation_path <- 'G:/group_project/data/aggregation_sites'
aggregation_shape <- list.files(aggregation_path, full.names = TRUE)

## Read in the shapefile as a simple feature
aggregation_sf <- sf::read_sf(aggregation_shape[6]) 

## Check the CRS of the simple feature to make sure it matches the Mozambique Raster 
st_crs(aggregation_sf)

## CRS matches so lets make a raster using the mz_rast_id to set the extent
aggregation_rast <- fasterize::fasterize(aggregation_sf, mz_rast_100)

# Aggregate to become a coarser resolution at 10000 m
aggregation_rast_agg <- raster::aggregate(aggregation_rast, fact=100, fun=sum, na.rm = TRUE)
aggregation_rast_agg_per <- aggregation_rast_agg/10000

## mask to the MZ EEZ
aggregation_rast_agg_per <- mask(aggregation_rast_agg_per, mz_eez_sf)

## Lets plot to see what it looks like
plot(aggregation_rast_agg_per)

## Save coral aggregate as raster
writeRaster(aggregation_rast_agg_per, here('set_up/final_rasters/planning_unit/aggregation_sites.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)

```
