## Scenario 5 - Inverse Combined Fishing Pressure 
The objective of this scenario was to protect important areas for sharks and rays based on their distribution from IUCN and location of suitable habitats while targeting the areas with high fishing pressure  For this run, we used the inverse of the combined fishing pressure layer as the cost, set targets of 20% for all conservation features, locked in planning units that included existing MPAs, and set a boundary penalty to zero. 

Step 1 reads in all the necessary data
Step 2 run to see results of varying targets from 10-50%
Step 3 to see varying targets using a boundary penalty
Step 4 to run sensitivity analysis of locking in vs locking out MPAs

----

### **STEP 1: Assign planning units, cost layer, and conservation feature**

#### Planning Unit
```{r}
# ### reading in the baseline MZ EEZ raster (with cell ids) 
pu_5 <- raster(here("set_up", "final_rasters", "mz_eez_templates", "mz_rast_id.tif"))

# ### plot to make sure it looks okay
plot(pu_5)
```

#### Cost Layer
```{r}
### pull in the combined fishing pressure tif file from costs folder in repo
cost_combined_inverse <- raster(here("set_up", "final_rasters", "costs", "combined_inverse_simple.tif"))

### plot to make sure it looks okay
plot(cost_combined_inverse)
```

#### Conservation Features
This includes all species distributions and habitat rasters
```{r}
# List of conservation features that will have been loaded into the global environment in other
### pull in species stack that we created in set-up step 3
features_stack_5 <- brick(here("set_up", "final_rasters", "conservation_features", "all_features_stack.tif"))

### plot to make sure it looks okay
plot(features_stack_5)
```

### Additional Files (Locked-in & Locked-out)
```{r}
### read in existing mpas raster
exist_mpas_5 <- raster(here("set_up", "final_rasters", "planning_unit", "exist_mpa.tif"))

### plot to make sure it looks okay
plot(exist_mpas_5)
```

### Set the some of the global model parameters like gap, time limit, and efficient boundary penalty to use in soem runs:
```{r}
# if you decide to change the gap, time-limit or boundary penalty value, change it here and rerun the subsequent model runs

gap <- 0.01
time_limit <- 21600
bp <- 0.000001
```
